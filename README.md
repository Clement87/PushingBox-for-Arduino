Thank you for downloading the Arduino source code for PushingBox.
Before you start don't forget to create an account on pushingbox.com, configure your services and create a scenario.


If you don't know what to do with your Arduino why don't you connect it to your mailbox and be notify when you have new mail :)
or, create your own twittering cat door
or, connect it to your doorbell and received a push on your phone, even if you are not at home.
There is so much things to do thanks to PushingBox,
we hope you enjoy the simplicity and the powerfulness of PushingBox :)
